## Week 3 

* We are proposing doing a two-phase study, in the first phase participants will see a paragraph about some quantitiative analysis with components about the data, the analysis, and the analyst. We will ask them overall whether they find the analysis believable and then will ask them to highlight portions of the text and rank the selection as making the overall information more or less believable
